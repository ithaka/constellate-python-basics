# Constellate Workshop Series Template

This repository is an example for teaching workshops and/or classes using [Constellate](https://constellate.org/). Constellate is the text analytics service from the not-for-profit [ITHAKA](https://www.ithaka.org/) - the same people who brought you [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/) and [Portico](https://www.portico.org/). It is a platform for teaching, learning, and performing text analysis using the world’s leading archival repositories of scholarly and primary source content.

Constellate enables schools of all sizes to teach data and text analytics with a learning platform that empowers faculty, librarians, and other instructors to educate a new generation of learners in text and data analysis. Our solution, centered on student and researcher success, provides text and data analysis capabilities and access to content from some of the world’s most respected databases in an open environment with a variety of teaching materials that can be used, modified, and shared. We envision a future where text and data analytics skills are being taught on Constellate in classes in all disciplines.

## The Constellate Lab

Institutions that subscribe to Constellate can use the Constellate Lab for teaching, learning, and research. The Constellate Lab will load Jupyter Notebooks from a GitHub repository. The repository must contain one or more Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files. These Notebook files could be developed in the Constellate Lab or on a local machine using an IDE such as [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), etc.  

## Opening a Repository with Constellate

Once a GitHub repository is created that contains at least one Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file, it can be opened with the Constellate Lab. 

1. Log into Constellate on an institutional network. Your institution should be identified in the upper-righthand corner.

Register for a personal JSTOR account in order to use Constellate. This is not the same thing as your institution's JSTOR account. This account will keep track of your personal files on Constellate, allowing you to do things like create, save, and delete your personal files, including datasets and notebooks.

2. Open your dashboard. Under Constellate Lab, choose "Import GitHub Repository." If you do not see Constellate Lab options, either your institution does not subscribe to Constellate or it is not being recognized.

3. Enter the URL for the repository you would like to load. You may optionally add a particular Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file and/or repository branch. A URL is generated that can be opened by anyone with a Constellate subscription. For example, the link could be shared with an entire class during an instruction session. Each student clicks on the link and the Constellate Lab will make a personal copy of the repository and open the Jupyter Notebook for them.
